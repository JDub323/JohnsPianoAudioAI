This is a list of bugs which I need to fix or features I need to add. Things are roughly written in order of priority. 

make sure the dataloader uses the correct dataframe indices so things are actually shuffled

fix many many issues with my model
write more unittests for buggy outputs
make a cli which can iterate over instances of data, their outputs, pre-processed, etc.
shuffle among shards as well as within shards
shuffle order of shards when training, shuffle training shard in between epochs
figure out how to analyze data from tensorboard
figure out why my metrics are constant and above 1
fix bug: when loading a checkpoint, not all tensors are put onto cuda
fix all memory leaks related to evaluation: RAM memory usage spikes after evaluation
fix checkpoint loading (best f1 not existing) # I think this is fixed
save data as torch.tensors rather than nested dictionaries
update model to be more effective
change how models are saved, put all instances from one run into its own folder
fix augmentation pipeline: sometimes too many augmentations drowning out piano
double shard size (they are a little bit small rn)
log spectrogram images and the corresponding predictions
add more logging
